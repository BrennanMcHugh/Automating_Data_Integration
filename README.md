# Automating_Data_Integration
Advanced Data Management (Automating Data Integration)

This repository contains my completed university performance assessment for the class D191 Advanced Data Management.

Within this repository are two files. 

The first is that assignment instructions document, detailing the premise and requirements for the project.

The second file is my submission.  It contains my code, queries, and a description of the process I used and the logic supporting my decisions.
